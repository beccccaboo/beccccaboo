### Rebecca Biju

Currently pursuing my Master of Science in Information Systems from Northeastern University, Boston, MA.

I am a `full-stack developer` and a `UX and DevOps Enthusiast`. With expertise in programming languages, cloud computing, and user experience design, I excel in developing scalable applications and collaborating with cross-functional teams

I am proficient in the `MERN` stack and also getting my hands dirty in `DevOps` using `AWS`.

I worked as an Associate Software Engineer at Oracle Financial Services Software Limited during the tenure of which I was exposed to the entire Software Development Lifecycle and deployed production level codes.
